My grandfather went down with the MonteVideo   
The rising sun sent him floating to his rest   
And his wife fled south to Sydney seeking out safe harbor   
A North Shore matron she became with some paying guests   
&nbsp;   
My father went down with the curse of big cities   
Traffic tolls and deadlines took him to his peace   
Now Bob Dyer glued us to our seats   
And lawns were always Victa neat   
Whilst Menzies fawned at royal fleet do you remember?   
&nbsp;   
In the valley I walk, I took some comfort there   
In the valley I walk, cold comfort I can hear you talk   
In the valley I walk, who will take me there?   
&nbsp;   
When my mother went down it was a stiff arm from Hades   
Life surprises and tears you like the southerly   
She always welcomed the spring always welcomed the stranger   
I don't see too many around like this   
&nbsp;   
In the valley I walk - who will take me there   
In the valley I walk - cold comfort I can hear you talk   
In the valley I walk - I took some comfort there   
In the valley I walk - oh rough justice I hear you talk   
In the valley I walk - to meet my watershed   
&nbsp;   
I hope virtue brings it's own reward   
And I hope the pen is mightier than any sword   
I hope the kids will take it slow   
I hope my country claims it's own   
&nbsp;   
In the valley I walk - I cried yes I cried I was down then I crawled   
Mercy's arms all around me when I was down there   
In the valley I walk - do you read me they can hear me in the valley
