Now it's time to say good night   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Now the sun turns out his light   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)   
Dream sweet dreams for you   
&nbsp;   
Close your eyes and I'll close mine   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Now the moon begins to shine   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)   
Dream sweet dreams for you   
&nbsp;   
Close your eyes and I'll close mine   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Now the sun turns out his light   
Good night sleep tight   
&nbsp;   
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)   
Dream sweet dreams for you   
&nbsp;   
Good night   
Good night everybody   
Everybody, everywhere   
Good night
