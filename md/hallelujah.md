Now I've heard there was a secret chord   
That David played, and it pleased the Lord   
But you don't really care for music, do you?   
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth   
The minor falls, the major lifts   
The baffled king composing Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
Your faith was strong but you needed proof   
You saw her bathing on the roof   
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you   
She tied you to a kitchen chair   
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair   
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
You say I took the name in vain   
I don't even know the name   
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?   
There's a blaze of light in every word   
It doesn't matter which you heard   
The holy or the broken Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
I did my best, it wasn't much   
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch   
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you   
And even though it all went wrong   
I'll stand before the Lord of Song   
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah   
&nbsp;   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah   
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
