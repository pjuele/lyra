This is the first day of my life   
Swear I was born right in the doorway   
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed   
They're spreading blankets on the beach   
&nbsp;   
Yours was the first face that I saw   
I think I was blind before I met you   
And I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been   
But I know where I want to go   
&nbsp;   
And so I thought I'd let you know   
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow   
But I realized that I need you   
And I wondered if I could come home   
&nbsp;   
Remember the time you drove all night   
Just to meet me in the morning?   
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed   
You felt as if you'd just woke up   
And you said   
&nbsp;   
"This is the first day of my life   
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you   
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you   
And I'd probably be happy"   
&nbsp;   
So if you wanna be with me   
With these things there's no telling   
We just have to wait and see   
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck   
Than waiting to win the lottery, ah-ha, mm-hmm   
&nbsp;   
Besides, maybe this time is different   
I mean, I really think you like me
